Remember to download all the assets, including the images
You can work with the values given to increase performance

Also you can run the command streamlit run Data.py to visualise some stats through streamlit

How it works:
The bot works by taking a screenshot (using a custom function) right in front of the player. At the start the width is small, but because the speed of the game increases, so does the width of the screenshot,
so that the bot has time to jump. The values are given on specific intervals of time, and can be changed for better performance. You can also add new intervals so that it goes for a longer time.

Good luck, hope you has fun!
